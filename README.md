# Mailing List Analysis Toolkit

This toolkit contains example code for how to develop a custom end-to-end email analytics service using the Open Data Hub on OpenShift. We demonstrate this by performing text analysis on the Fedora mailing list. This list contains many discussions about the issues occurring with Fedora development on a monthly basis and suggestions for how to address the issues.

This project aims to help the Fedora community bring a more data driven approach to their planning process by performing text analysis and gathering insights into the trends in the email conversations.

The purpose of this project is to develop and maintain an open source NLP application that provides regular and up-to-date analytics for large open source development project  mailing lists.

Although the specific example here is a mailing list analysis tool, our hope is to show that this approach could be easily modified and adapted to many intelligent application use cases.
